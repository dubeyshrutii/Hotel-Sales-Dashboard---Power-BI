# 🏨 Hotel Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project'


### 📌 Project Objective
Hotels often struggle to understand how well their rooms are performing, which months bring in the most revenue, and what types of customers are booking most. This lack of insight leads to missed opportunities in increasing revenue, optimizing pricing, and improving customer experience.

What’s working and what’s not

When bookings are highest or lowest

Which room types are most profitable

Who their customers really are
